# mfusepy

`mfusepy` is a Python module that provides a simple interface to [FUSE](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/fuse.html) and [macFUSE](https://osxfuse.github.io/).
It's just one file and is implemented using ctypes to use [libfuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse).


# Installation

```bash
pip install mfusepy
```

You also need to install the `fuse` (2) or [`fuse3`](https://pkgs.org/search/?q=fuse3) package on your system.


# About this fork

This is a fork of [fusepy](https://github.com/fusepy/fusepy) because it did not see any development for over 6 years.
[Refuse](https://github.com/pleiszenburg/refuse/) was an attempt to fork fusepy, but it has not seen any development for over 4 years. Among lots of metadata changes, it contains two bugfixes to the high-level API, which I have redone in this fork.
See also the discussion in [this issue](https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount/issues/101).
I intend to maintain this fork as long as I maintain [ratarmount](https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount), which is now over 5 years old.

The main motivations for forking are:

 - [x] FUSE 3 support. Based on the [libfuse changelog](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/master/ChangeLog.rst#libfuse-300-2016-12-08), the amount of breaking changes should be fairly small. It should be possible to simply update these ten or so changed structs and functions in the existing fusepy.
 - [x] Translation layer performance. In benchmarks for a simple `find` call for listing all files, some callbacks such as `readdir` turned out to be significantly limited by converting Python dictionaries to ctype structs. The idea would be to expose the ctype structs to the fusepy caller.
   - Much of the performance was lost trying to populate the stat struct even though only the mode member is used by the kernel FUSE API.

The prefix `m` in the name stands for anything you want it to: "multi" because multiple libfuse versions are supported, "modded", "modern", or "Maximilian".


# Comparison to other libraries

## High-level interface support (path-based)

| [fusepyng](https://pypi.org/project/fusepyng/)       | ISC  | [0](https://www.wheelodex.org/projects/fusepyng/rdepends/) | Dead fork of fusepy. Github repo has been force-pushed as a statement. Fork [here](https://github.com/djsutherland/fusepyng). |
| [userspacefs](https://pypi.org/project/userspacefs/)  | GPL3 (why not ISC?) | [1](https://www.wheelodex.org/projects/userspacefs/rdepends/) | Fork of fusepyng/fusepy. Gated behind self-hosting solution with no possibility to open issues or pull requests. |
| [fusepy3](https://github.com/fox-it/fusepy3)          | ISC  | Not on PyPI | Fork of fusepy for [fox-it/dissect](https://github.com/fox-it/dissect) ecosystem to add libfuse3 support. Seems to drop libfuse2 support though and I it does not seem to work around the ABI [incompatibilities](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/issues/1029) between libfuse3 minor versions. Last update 9 months ago. Looks like publish and forget, or it may simply have no bugs. |


## Low-level interface support (inode/int-based)

All these libraries only wrap the low-level libfuse interface, which works with inodes instead of paths, and therefore are not (easily) usable for my use case.
In the end, there is mostly only some path-to-hash table in the high-level libfuse API, but it is cumbersome to implement and performance-critical.

# Platforms

mfusepy requires FUSE 2.6 (or later) and runs on:

- Linux (i386, x86_64, PPC, arm64, MIPS)
- Mac OS X (Intel, PowerPC)
- FreeBSD (i386, amd64)

While FUSE is (at least in the Unix world) a [Kernel feature](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/fuse.4.html), several user space libraries exist for easy access.
`libfuse` acts as the reference implementation.

 - [libfuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) (Linux, FreeBSD) (fuse.h [2](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/fuse-2_9_bugfix/include/fuse.h) [3](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/master/include/fuse.h))
